# Logging

## Overview

Python offers two primary methods for outputting information: `print()` for simple console outputs and `logging` for more advanced, configurable logging.

### Print Statements

- **Function:** `print()` is a basic function used for debugging and displaying quick information.
- **Limitation:** Not suitable for production due to overhead.

### Logging

- **Advantage:** Allows detailed control over log messages, including level, destination, and format.
- **Levels:** `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL` for filtering severity.
- **Application:** Ideal for production-grade applications to monitor and analyze behavior.

### Comparison: Printing vs. Logging

- `print()`: Simple, immediate output to the console. Syntax: `print(object, file=open("new_file.txt", "w"))`.
- `logging`: Object-oriented, allows severity levels, multiple destinations, and filtering.

### Built-in Logging Levels

- Provided by the logging module: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`.
- Example:

  ```python
  import logging
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
  logging.debug("This is a DEBUG message.")
  ```

### **Handlers in Logging**

- **Function:** Define log message destinations.
- **Types:** **`StreamHandler`**, **`FileHandler`**, **`RotatingFileHandler`**, etc.
- **Usage:** Attach handlers to loggers for advanced management.
- **Custom Logger Example:**

```python
import logging
stream_logger = logging.getLogger('stream_logger')
stream_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
stream_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
stream_logger.addHandler(stream_handler)
```

### **Advanced Use Cases**

- Logging business data to a database for monitoring and alerting.

## **Key Takeaways**

- **Print Statement Overhead:** Avoid in production due to overhead.
- **Severity Levels:** Crucial for distinguishing issue severity.
- **Advanced Log Management:** Use handlers for directing messages to various destinations.

## Logging Module

### Overview

The logging module in Python is a versatile tool for both novice and professional developers. It integrates seamlessly with third-party libraries, enabling the creation of a uniform log for applications.

### Key Features

- **Logging Activities:** Records program actions, variable values, output from components, and performance data.
- **Customization:** Allows for tailored log formatting and detail levels.
- **Severity Levels:** Five levels - DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL - to classify message importance.

### Severity Levels

1. **DEBUG:** Detailed information for debugging (e.g., parameter values).
2. **INFO:** General program activity (e.g., database connections).
3. **WARNING:** Non-critical errors (e.g., slow queries, missing config files).
4. **ERROR:** Serious, recoverable errors (e.g., failed database connections).
5. **CRITICAL:** Fatal errors leading to program termination.

### Logger Initialization

- **Basic Setup:** Import the logging module, set the minimum level (e.g., INFO), and create a logger instance with `__name__`.
- **Example:**

  ```python
  import logging
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
  log.info("Hello world")
  ```

### **Alternatives to Logging Module**

- **structlog:** Outputs logs in structured JSON format for easy parsing by monitoring systems.
- **colorlog:** Adds color highlights to log levels for easy identification in the console.

## Exception Handling in Python

### Overview

Exception handling in Python is crucial for managing errors that disrupt the normal flow of a program. It helps to ensure that a program does not crash and provides a way to respond to errors effectively.

### Examples of Exceptions

- Dividing by zero
- Referencing a nonexistent variable
- Opening a nonexistent file
- Failing to connect to a remote server

## Common Types of Exceptions

- **NameError:** Typo in a variable name
- **AttributeError:** Mistake in calling a method on an object
- **ValueError:** Incorrect parameter value
- **TypeError:** Wrong type or number of arguments in a function call
- **ImportError:** Python unable to find a module
- **FileNotFoundError:** Operations on a nonexistent file or directory

## `except` Statements

The `except` statement in Python is used to catch and handle specific exceptions. It allows for recovery from errors or user notification.

### Example

```python
try:
    f = open("/etc/hosts", "w+")
except IOError as ex:
    print("Error appending to file: " + str(ex))
else:
    f.close()
```

## Exception Handling in Python

Exception handling in Python is used to manage errors or exceptions during program execution. The key commands include `try/except`, `raise`, and `finally`.

## Using `try/except`

`try/except` is used when there's a possibility of an error occurring. It acts as a safety net to catch errors.

### Example 1: Handling Undefined Variables

```python
try:
  print(x)
except NameError:
  print("Variable x is not defined")
```

### Example 2: Handling File Operations

```python
try:
  f = open("/etc/hosts", "w+")
  f.write("Success!")
except FileNotFoundError:
  print("Data file not found")
except Exception as ex:
  print("Error appending to file: " + str(ex))
else:
  f.close()
```

### Using `raise`

`raise` is used to signal an error condition, stopping the program when it can't continue due to an error or incorrect input.

#### Example 1: Type Checking

```python
x = "hello"
if not isinstance(x, int):
  raise TypeError("Only integers are allowed")
```

#### Example 2: Validating Port Numbers

```python
def start_server(port):
  if not isinstance(port, int):
    raise TypeError("Port number must be an integer")
  elif port < 1024 or port > 65535:
    raise ValueError("Port number is invalid")
```

### Using `finally`

`finally` is used for cleanup actions that must occur whether an exception was raised or not. It's often used for releasing resources.

#### Example: Ensuring Resource Cleanup

```python
try:
  f = open("/etc/hosts", "w+")
except Exception as ex:
  print("Error appending to file: " + str(ex))
finally:
  if 'f' in locals():
      f.close()  # Closes the file if it was opened
```

### Key Takeaways

`try/except` allows catching errors before they crash the program.
`raise` signals when a code can't continue due to an error.
`finally` ensures cleanup actions are executed regardless of exception

## Introduction to Python Email Library

### Overview

Creating email messages in Python is simplified by the `email` module, which adheres to the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards.

### Creating an Email Message

- **Class Used:** `email.message.EmailMessage`
- **Steps:**
  1. Import and create an empty email message:

     ```python
     from email.message import EmailMessage
     message = EmailMessage()
     print(message)
     ```

  2. Define sender and recipient:

     ```python
     sender = "me@example.com"
     recipient = "you@example.com"
     ```

  3. Add sender and recipient to the message:

     ```python
     message['From'] = sender
     message['To'] = recipient
     print(message)
     ```

### Adding Email Components

- **Subject Line:**

  ```python
  message['Subject'] = 'Greetings from {} to {}!'.format(sender, recipient)
  print(message)
  ```

### Message Body

```python
body = """Hey there!
I'm learning to send emails using Python!"""
message.set_content(body)
print(message)
```

### **Understanding Email Headers**

- **Headers Used:** From, To, and Subject
- **Purpose:** Key-value pairs that guide email clients and servers.
- **Additional Headers:** Automatically added by **`set_content()`**, like MIME-Version, Content-Type, and Content-Transfer-Encoding, to inform how to process the email content.

### **Key Takeaways**

- The **`email`** module in Python simplifies the process of creating email messages, compliant with SMTP and MIME standards.
- Email messages consist of headers (From, To, Subject) and the message body, with additional headers for content type and encoding.
- MIME-Version and Content-Type headers are essential for the correct interpretation of email content across various clients and servers.

## Sending the Email Through an SMTP Server

To send emails, Python utilizes the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) with the `smtplib` module.

```python
import smtplib
mail_server = smtplib.SMTP('localhost')
```

```markdown
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  (...We deleted a bunch of lines here...)
ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 61] Connection refused
```

- **Local SMTP Server:** Attempting to create a local server may result in **`ConnectionRefusedError`**.
- **Remote SMTP Server:** Use a remote SMTP server of your personal email service.

### **Secure Connection and Authentication**

- **Secure Connection:** Use **`smtplib.SMTP_SSL`** for a secure SMTP connection over SSL/TLS.

```python
mail_server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.example.com')
```

- **Debugging**: Set debug level to see SMTP messages.

```python
mail_server.set_debuglevel(1)
```

- **Authentication**
  - Use **`getpass`** to securely input password.

    ```python
    import getpass
    mail_pass = getpass.getpass('Password? ')
    ```

  - Login using the SMTP object's **`login`** method.

    ```python
    mail_server.login(sender, mail_pass)
    ```

  - `mail_pass` is still an ordinary string.

    ```python
    print(mail_pass)
    #It'sASecr3t!
    ```

  - SMTP login

    ```python
    mail_server.login(sender, mail_pass)
    #(235, b'2.7.0 Accepted')
    ```

### **Sending the Email**

- **Method:** **`send_message`** sends the email.

```python
mail_server.send_message(message)

```

- **Response:** Returns a dictionary of recipients who couldnâ€™t receive the message.

### **Closing the Connection**

```python
mail_server.quit()

```

## Generating PDFs

In Python, when you want to create a custom PDF report, the **`ReportLab`** library is a powerful tool you can use. It offers a range of features for PDF generation, but we'll focus on the basics here, particularly using the PLATYPUS system within ReportLab.

### **Creating a PDF Report with ReportLab**

1. **Representing Data**:
First, let's say you have a collection of fruit data represented in a Python dictionary:

    ```python
    fruit = {
      "elderberries": 1,
      "figs": 1,
      "apples": 2,
      "durians": 3,
      "bananas": 5,
      "cherries": 8,
      "grapes": 13
    }
    
    ```

2. **Setting Up the PDF Document**:
Use the **`SimpleDocTemplate`** class to start building your PDF.

    ```python
    from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate
    report = SimpleDocTemplate("/tmp/report.pdf")
    
    ```

    This code creates a **`report`** object targeting the output file **`/tmp/report.pdf`**.

3. **Working with Flowables**:
    - Import Flowable classes:

        ```python

        from reportlab.platypus import Paragraph, Spacer, Table, Image
        
        ```

        These classes (Paragraph, Spacer, Table, Image) are used to build elements in your document.

    - Setting up styles:

        ```python

        from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet
        styles = getSampleStyleSheet()
        
        ```

        You can use the default styles like **`h1`** for headers.

    - Adding a title:

        ```python

        report_title = Paragraph("A Complete Inventory of My Fruit", styles["h1"])
        
        ```

4. **Building the PDF**:
    - Combine the elements and build the PDF:This line generates a PDF with the specified title.

        ```python

        report.build([report_title])
        
        ```

### Adding Tables

Adding tables to your PDF reports in Python using ReportLab can enhance the readability and structure of the information. Here's how you can do it:

### **Converting Dictionary to a List of Lists**

Given a dictionary of fruit inventory, convert it into a list-of-lists format suitable for creating a table. For example:

```pytho
fruit = {"elderberries": 1, "figs": 1, "apples": 2, "durians": 3, "bananas": 5, "cherries": 8, "grapes": 13}
table_data = [[key, value] for key, value in fruit.items()]

```

This code transforms the **`fruit`** dictionary into a list-of-lists called **`table_data`**.

### **Creating the Table in the Report**

- **Creating a Table Object**:

    ```python
    from reportlab.platypus import Table
    report_table = Table(data=table_data)
    
    ```

- **Building the PDF with the Table**:This builds the PDF with the title and the newly added table.

    ```python
    report.build([report_title, report_table])
    
    ```

### **Adding Style to the Table**

- **Importing TableStyle**:

    ```python
    from reportlab.lib import colors
    from reportlab.platypus import TableStyle
    
    ```

- **Defining and Applying the Style**:This code adds a black grid to the table and aligns it to the left.

    ```python
    table_style = [('GRID', (0, 0), (-1, -1), 1, colors.black)]
    report_table = Table(data=table_data, style=table_style, hAlign="LEFT")
    report.build([report_title, report_table])
    
    ```

### **Result**

After adding the table with the specified style, the PDF report becomes more structured and visually appealing, making the data easier to read.

Adding graphics, such as pie charts, to your PDFs in Python can be accomplished with ReportLab's **`Drawing`** Flowable class. Here's how you can incorporate a graphical element into your report:

### **Adding Graphics**

1. **Import Necessary Classes**:

    ```python
    from reportlab.graphics.shapes import Drawing
    from reportlab.graphics.charts.piecharts import Pie
    
    ```

    These imports are necessary for creating the pie chart.

2. **Initialize the Pie Chart**:

    ```python
    report_pie = Pie(width=3*inch, height=3*inch)
    
    ```

    Here, you're creating a **`Pie`** object with specified dimensions.

3. **Prepare Data and Labels**:
To populate the pie chart, convert your fruit dictionary into two lists - one for the data and one for the labels. Sort the fruits alphabetically for added clarity.

    ```python
    report_pie.data = []
    report_pie.labels = []
    for fruit_name in sorted(fruit):
        report_pie.data.append(fruit[fruit_name])
        report_pie.labels.append(fruit_name)
    
    ```

    This code sorts the fruit names and appends their respective quantities and names to the **`data`** and **`labels`** attributes of the **`Pie`** object.

4. **Embedding the Pie Chart into a Drawing**:
Since a **`Pie`** object isn't Flowable, it needs to be placed inside a **`Drawing`** object.

    ```python
    report_chart = Drawing()
    report_chart.add(report_pie)
    
    ```

    This places the pie chart within a drawable area.

5. **Adding the Drawing to the Report**:
Finally, add this drawing to your report:

    ```python
    report.build([report_title, report_table, report_chart])
    
    ```

    This line constructs the PDF with the title, table, and pie chart.

### **Result**

The final PDF should now contain a title, a styled table, and a colorful pie chart representing your data.
