# Process Text Files to Upload to Web App

## Objective
The primary aim of this project is to develop a script capable of interfacing with an active web service. This web service is an integral component of our company's website, dedicated to the management and presentation of customer reviews.

## Scope of Work

The script must be designed to access customer reviews that are currently stored in text file format on a local disk.
It should efficiently process these reviews, converting them into a format that is compatible with the web service's requirements.
Upon successful formatting, the script is responsible for transmitting the reviews to the web service, ensuring their proper storage and display.
