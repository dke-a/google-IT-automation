# Module 1 Project

## Problem Statement

The newly delivered icon graphics from a design contractor are not meeting the required standards – they are in an incorrect format, wrongly oriented (rotated 90°), and oversized. Given the approaching deadline and the unavailability of the design team for quick revisions, an alternative solution is essential.

## Solution Requirement

A Python script is required to process these images efficiently. The script's purpose is to correct the format, orientation, and size of the images, making them suitable for the website's updated look.

## Objectives

**Format Adjustment:** The images need conversion to a format compatible with the website's technical requirements.

**Orientation Correction:** Each image should be rotated by 90° to align with the website's layout specifications.

**Size Reduction:** Resizing the images to dimensions that fit seamlessly into the website design.

## Solution Approach

1. **Local Development and Testing:** The script will be crafted and tested locally using a sample of the provided images. This step is critical to ensure the script's effectiveness and reliability before large-scale deployment.
2. **Cloud Deployment:** After successful local testing, the script will be executed in a Cloud-based Virtual Machine (VM) provided by Qwiklabs. This environment offers a robust and scalable platform for extensive image processing.
3. **Time Management Considerations:** Due to the limited access to the VM, all script development and testing phases are to be completed in advance to maximize efficiency during the cloud processing stage.
4. **Quality Assurance:** After processing, a selection of images will undergo a quality check to verify that the modifications meet the intended design requirements.
