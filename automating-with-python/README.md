**Skills/Technologies:** **`Python`** **`PIL`** **`Distributed Systems`** **`NALSD`** **`VS Studio`** **`Docker`** **`Web Services`** **`RESTful APIs`** **`Flask`** **`Python Requests Library`** **`Django`** **`Logging`** **`SMTP`** **`PDF Generation`**

## **Module 1 - Manipulating Images**
`/m1-manipulating-image`

In this module, the focus was on understanding distributed systems and Non Abstract Large System Design (NALSD). Key distinctions between built-in and external libraries were explored, alongside an in-depth look at APIs. The module delved into container management with an emphasis on VS Studio and Docker. Utilizing the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image manipulation was a significant part of the coursework. The practical application of these concepts was demonstrated in a lab, where image scaling and format conversion using PIL were executed.

## **Module 2 - Interacting with Web Services**
`/m2-webapps-services`

This module provided insights into web applications, services, and APIs, particularly RESTful APIs and REST architecture. There was a comprehensive learning segment on using REST APIs for web data access. Flask and data serialization were covered, enhancing understanding of web frameworks. The Python Requests Library was introduced, with an emphasis on HTTP GET and POST methods. Django, a full-stack web framework, was also part of the curriculum. A lab session involved processing text files with Python dictionaries and uploading them to a running web service using Django.

## **Module 3 - Automatic Output Generation**
`/m3-automatic-output-gen`

Logging, the logging module, and exception handling were the initial focus of this module. Subsequent sessions covered the Python email library, including the intricacies of adding attachments and utilizing the SMTP server for sending emails. Generating PDFs with added tables and graphics was a key learning area. The culmination of this module was a lab that involved generating a PDF report and dispatching it via email, integrating multiple skills learned throughout the module.

## **Module 4 - Final Project: Putting It All Together**
`/final-project`


The final project encapsulated the entire learning journey. It began with a review of the project problem statement and resources for problem-solving. The challenge was to automate the updating of catalog information, a task that integrated all the skills and concepts learned in the course. The project involved writing a script to update an online catalog, generating and sending a PDF via email, and writing a script to monitor system health. This project mirrored real-world scenarios, requiring a synthesis of multiple skills.
