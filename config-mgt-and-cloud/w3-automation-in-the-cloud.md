# Automation in the Cloud

## Cloud Computing

### Cloud Services Overview

#### Defining "Cloud Services"

- **Cloud Services**: Services running remotely in data centers or on servers accessible over the Internet.
- **Variety of Machines**: Data centers house diverse machines, like those with SSDs for performance or virtual drives for cost efficiency.

#### Types of Cloud Services

1. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
   - Complete applications delivered by cloud providers (e.g., Gmail, Dropbox, Microsoft Office 365).
   - Minimal customization options; provider manages hosting, capacity, backups, etc.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
   - Preconfigured platforms offered by cloud providers.
   - Example: SQL database as a service, freeing users from installation and maintenance tasks.

3. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:
   - Provides bare-bones computing experience, typically virtual machines and networking components.
   - High control level; users manage their software and configurations.
   - Popular IaaS examples: Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure Compute.

#### Cloud Regions and Zones

- **Regions**: Geographical locations with multiple data centers.â—Š
- **Zones**: Contain one or more data centers within a region.
- **Service Migration**: In case of a data center failure, services can be moved to other zones.
- **Choice Criteria**:
  - Proximity to users to reduce latency.
  - Legal or policy requirements for data storage locations.
  - Proximity to service dependencies.

#### Case Example: Qwiklabs

- **Service Model**: Uses Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
- **Deployment**: VMs provisioned with OS, and lab automation deploys additional software.

### Scaling in the Cloud

#### Traditional IT vs. Cloud Scaling

- **Traditional IT**: Scaling involves buying hardware, installing software, and integrating with infrastructure.
- **Cloud Scaling**: Easier and quicker to scale up or down based on service usage.

#### Understanding Capacity

- **Definition**: Capacity refers to how much a service can deliver.
- **Measurement**: Depends on the system's purpose (e.g., disk space for storage, queries per second for web servers).
- **Change Over Time**: Capacity needs can increase or decrease, leading to scaling.

#### Types of Cloud Scaling

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Adding more nodes to a service pool.
   - Example: Using multiple Apache web servers to increase concurrent connections.

2. **Vertical Scaling**:
   - Enhancing the resources of existing nodes (memory, CPU, disk space).
   - Example: Increasing disk space on a database server or memory on a caching server.

#### Deployment Modification

- **Cloud vs. On-Premise**: In the cloud, scaling is done through a web UI or configuration management system instead of physical hardware changes.

#### Automatic vs. Manual Scaling

- **Automatic Scaling**:
  - Uses metrics to adjust capacity based on demand.
  - Example: Scaling cat video service based on viewer demand.
  - Risk: Potential for high costs if not capped.
  
- **Manual Scaling**:
  - Controlled by humans, suitable for less complex or smaller-scale deployments.
  - Example: Adding a mail server based on projected growth.
  - Risk: Without monitoring, unexpected demand can lead to performance issues or outages.

#### Cloud Benefits and Challenges

- **Benefits**: Flexibility and ease of scaling.
- **Intimidation Factor**: Complexity and new concepts can be daunting.
- **Next Topic**: Addressing hesitations about migrating to the cloud and overcoming related challenges.

### Evaluating the Cloud

#### Traditional IT vs. Cloud

- **Control in Traditional IT**: Full control over hardware, software, and network.
- **Shifting Control in Cloud**: In cloud solutions, some control is relinquished to the cloud provider.

#### Service Models and Control Levels

1. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Limited control; provider manages the application.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Control over code, but not application running.
3. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: High level of control over OS, applications.

#### Vendor Dependency

- **Support Requirements**: Dependency on vendor support for some issues.
- **Selecting Providers**: Importance of choosing providers with suitable support and service levels.

#### Concerns with Cloud Migration

- **Hardware and Network Management**: Reluctance to give up control over these aspects.
- **Security Considerations**:
  - Verifying provider's security measures (certifications like SOC 1, ISO 27001).
  - User responsibility for security (e.g., strong passwords, firewalls).

#### Implementing Security in the Cloud

- **Shared Responsibility**: Both cloud providers and users play a role in security.
- **Cost vs. Security**: Balancing specialized security measures with implementation costs.
- **Data Sensitivity**: Tailoring security practices to the sensitivity of the data.

#### Other Cloud Concerns

- **Data Storage Location**: Concerns about where data is stored geographically.
- **Support Quality**: Potential worries about the adequacy of provider support.

#### Preparing for Cloud Migration

- **Understanding Terms of Service**: Essential to comprehend the conditions and services offered.
- **Risk Management**: Preparing with appropriate security measures.

#### Next Steps

- Detailed exploration of cloud migration processes in the upcoming video.

### Migrating to the Cloud

#### Migration Considerations

- **Trade-off**: Balancing control over computers with the effort required for maintenance.
- **Goals**: Determining the objectives of migrating to a cloud provider.

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- **Control and Flexibility**: High control over infrastructure design, choice of machine types, and storage.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for administrators using a 'lift and shift' strategy.

#### Lift and Shift Strategy

- **Concept**: Migrating physical servers to virtual machines in the cloud.
- **Core Configurations**: Remain the same, whether hosted on-site or in the cloud.
- **Configuration Management**: Existing tools can be applied to VMs in the cloud for easy setup replication.

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- **Management Ease**: Focus on using the platform rather than day-to-day management (e.g., SQL databases, web applications).
- **Examples**: Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft App Service, Google App Engine.

#### Containers

- **Portability**: Packaged applications with configuration and dependencies, consistent across environments.
- **Flexibility**: Easy migration between on-premise servers and various cloud providers.

#### Types of Cloud Environments

1. **Public Cloud**: Services provided by third parties to the public.
2. **Private Cloud**: Company-owned services, whether on-site or remote.
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: Mix of public and private clouds, integrated for seamless data access and management.
4. **Multi-Cloud**: Combines multiple public and/or private clouds across vendors.
   - Hybrid Cloud is a type of Multi-Cloud.
   - Benefits: Extra protection through vendor diversification.

## Automating Cloud Deployments

### Scaling and Load Balancing in Cloud Services

#### Key Features of Cloud Services

- **Scalability**: Ability to easily scale services up or down.
- **Preparation**: Setting up services for easy capacity increase by adding more nodes.

#### Load Balancing

![](images/20231208223505.png)

- **Purpose**: Ensures balanced request distribution across nodes.
- **Strategies**: Various methods like round-robin, origin-based, proximity-based, and load-based selection.

#### Autoscaling

- **Functionality**: Automatically increases or decreases capacity based on demand.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for the resources in use at any given time.
- **Ephemeral Nodes**: Nodes and local disks are short-lived; data persistence requires separate storage resources.

#### Database Integration

- **Cloud-Based Databases**: Multiple nodes managed by Cloud provider, usually under a Platform as a Service model.

#### Example: Large Web Application

- **User Connection**: Retrieval of website IP address leading to an entry point.
- **Scaling**: Multiple entry points for reliability and latency reduction.
- **Layers**: Includes web caching servers, actual web services, and additional database caching.

#### Caching Mechanisms

- **Web Caching Servers**: Applications like Varnish, Nginx, or services like Cloudflare and Fastly.
- **Database Caching**: Uses applications like Memcached or Redis for quick data retrieval.

#### Handling Complex Deployments

- **Infrastructure Management**: Cloud provider automates instance management, load distribution, and regional capacity adjustments.

### What is Orchestration

### Automation and Orchestration in Cloud Computing
